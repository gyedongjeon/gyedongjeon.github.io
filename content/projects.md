## Deutschmock
> AI-Driven Practice & Feedback for German Writing Exams

Deutschmock is a full-stack platform designed to help users prepare for German proficiency exams, specifically focusing on the writing (Schreiben) section, through AI-driven feedback.

* **Tech Stack:**
    * **Frontend:** Next.js 16 (React 19), Tailwind CSS 4, Radix UI
    * **Backend:** NestJS, PostgreSQL (TypeORM), Passport.js (JWT/OAuth)
    * **AI:** Google Gemini API (Generative AI Integration)
* **Key Strategic Implementations:**
    * **AI Score Enhancement:** Analyzes test patterns and provides actionable feedback specifically designed to improve exam outcomes.
    * **Internationalization & Resource Management:** Supports 40+ languages and features **Usage Quota Management** by implementing authenticated request limits to manage operational costs and ensure fair resource distribution.
* **Methodology: Adopted an AI-augmented engineering workflow to achieve high-velocity development and rapid prototyping across the full stack.
